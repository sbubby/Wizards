Some info:

In the “main” folder, the only thing that should be modified is functions/loop.mcfunction
This function is used to call other functions and runs every tick.

The “name” folder is just some loot table experimentation that doesn’t work at the moment. It gives a single error message in the launcher log when using /reload.

“minecraft” again, should technically not need modification. It just tells the game to loop the function in the main folder.

“wizards” contains all the spells I have thus far, and some other folders which I got from these videos:
